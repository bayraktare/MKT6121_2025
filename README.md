# 📷 MKT6121 - Machine Vision Applications in Mechatronics

**Advanced Image Processing Suite**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a base GUI framework for the MKT6121 Machine Vision Applications in Mechatronics course. The GUI, built with PyQt6, allows students to implement and test various image processing techniques.

The framework includes basic functionalities like opening images and videos, and it's designed to be extended by students. You'll add image processing methods, improve the GUI, and integrate advanced features throughout the course.

## 📚 Course Project Instructions

Students will incrementally develop this image processing GUI throughout the semester. The final project will be a comprehensive image processing application with a user-friendly interface and a variety of implemented techniques.

### 🎯 Key Requirements:

*   **Implement Image Processing Methods:**  Add a range of image processing techniques (filtering, edge detection, segmentation, etc.) to the GUI.
*   **Enhance the GUI:** Improve the existing GUI design, add user controls, and optimize for usability.
*   **Integrate Advanced Features:** Explore and implement advanced concepts like object detection, feature extraction, or machine learning in image processing.
*   **Documentation:**  Maintain clear and concise documentation of your code and implemented features.
*   **Regular Submissions:** Submit updates according to the course schedule through GitHub.
